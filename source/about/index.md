Welcome to my blog!

My name is Zuo Junbo, and I am a developer who passionately transforms coffee into code every day.

I'm currently working on the Mini Games platform at WeChat. Before joining WeChat, I was a game engine developer at Tencent Games, where I contributed to projects such as [Delta Force](https://df.qq.com/), [Apex Legends Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.apexlegendsmobilefps&hl=en&gl=US), [Call of Duty Mobile](https://www.callofduty.com/mobile), [Cross Fire Mobile](https://cfm.qq.com/), [PUBGM](https://pubgm.qq.com/index.shtml), and several confidential initiatives.

Prior to my time at Tencent, I also worked on the development of [Nikki 4th](https://nikki4.papegames.cn/) and [Hidden Dragon: Shadow Trace](http://ylz.wanmei.com/).

My interests lie in game physics, animation, performance optimization, toolchain development, and procedural generation.

This blog mainly focuses on sharing development-related experiences and insights. I hope you find the content here both informative and engaging.
